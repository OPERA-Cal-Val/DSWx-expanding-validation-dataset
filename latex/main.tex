\tiny
\begin{itemize}
\item 52 validation sites across 4 strata defined in \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425720301620}{Pickens et al.} - chips are reclassified into appropriate strata based on current water extents.
\begin{itemize}
\tiny
\item Strata 0: Dry (0$\%$ water): 14 sites
\item Strata 1: low water ($>0$ and $\leq.08\%$): 11 sites
\item Strata 2: moderate  water ($>0.08\%$ and $\leq 2\%$): 13 sites
\item Strata 3: high water ($>2\%$): 14 sites
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

 \\[2\baselineskip]

The minimum accuracy requirements on OSW and PSW are:
\begin{itemize}
\item 80\% accuracy for OSW on 80\% of datasets
\item 70\% accuracy for PSW on 80\% of datasets
\end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Model Summary}
  \vfill
  Model training:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Random forest model with 300 estimators
    \item Using the green, red, and NIR channels of the Planet image, we segment our input image using the Felzenszwalb algorithm (scale=2, min size=5, sigma=1.5) \\
    \item We compute NDWI and NDVI values from the Planet image
    \item We compute the mean and standard deviation for all segments for the following set of channels: [Red, NIR, Green, NDWI, NDVI]
    \item The resulting model has a precision and recall of \\
    \begin{itemize}
    \item 99.83\% and 99.02\% for not-water 
    \item 88.19\% and 96.29\% for open surface water 
    \end{itemize}
